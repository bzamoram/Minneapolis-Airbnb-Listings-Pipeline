Host indicated that 'he shouldn't be financially penalized for our inability to adapt'. \nThe house was very minimally equipped, probably fine for only a few days. The host did agree to provide more kitchenware and the like but over a week later and after we had decided to move out. \nThe pictures of the inside of the house are accurate as it has been redone to a modern standard but the niceness ends at the very back door of the unit - lots of rules (don't use main door, laundry only two days a week) and loud neighbors. Very unpleasant neighborhood with many homeless people and drug use."

Came in summer and there were a/c units throughout the home to keep the place cool. Lots of cozy throw blankets to cuddle up with even though it was summer. Easy walks to market and coffee shop. We were in town for a wedding. It was busy enough that we could have appreciated more time to just hangout."

Krista provided us with a code and instructions that were easy to follow. As I walked in I noticed that there was a sign with my name on it greeting us! I loved it !\nThen we all walked in and were in awe of how nice the inside was. It was very clean and beautifully decorated. We had everything we needed like it was our own home minus food. \nThe rooms were spacious and beds were comfortable. We had enough towels and blankets. Everything was great ! We would definitely stay here again and definitely recommend this place !"

Unexpectedly, this year our usual accommodation plans with family fell apart at the eleventh hour and very last minute I was scrambling to find a place for us to stay. What good fortune that we found  Denise's place!!\nIt is very conveniently located near my parents' home and my dad even stayed with us at Denise's several nights in the cool 'Dad Pad' downstairs. It is attractrive, bright, clean, cosy, and well-kitted out. (I even made use of the Kitchen-Aid to make cookies for friends and family when they came round to visit us! 😄)\nDenise is an amazing host!! Quick to reply and sorting out anything that needed fixing. She was a kind, generous, and überfriendly host! I would recommend anyone to stay here, especially if needing a homebase for several days, as we were. We had 12 days/nights well enjoyed in Hopkins at Denise's!! Thank you Denise!"

The place was less clean than our preference with the shower and bathroom particularly having hair and film and stains. However the rest was clean. The toilet did stop flushing however it was a quick fix with my spouse. We let them know if concerns and issues at check out with little interaction or response to our feedback. With all that being said we would come back and rent as it  was well centrally located and now we know what to expect. Thank you."

I appreciated his communication.\nI only had a bottom sheet on my bed and there were stains on the mattress pad (cleaned, but stained with blood? and cigarette hole maybe), so I asked the host about that. Someone came and changed the sheets for me late, but before I was asleep, but they didn't have a new mattress pad (which felt reasonable to me, as they did what they could).\nThere were a couple of vertical blind panels missing on the patio window, so I didn't have full privacy and ended up propping up a broom with a towel to block out light. The host said he would follow up with maintenance about it. \nDefinitely more of a corporate Airbnb than a property someone really has cared for and made sure has all of i's dotted. It was a bit dusty, so I think they're still working out their cleaning rhythm but not terrible. \nThe checkin process requires selfie, drivers license on 3rd party site for security."

The apartment complex is easy to find and the website used for check-in was easy. There is a front desk and the woman working was kind enough to help me with the key box since the software froze when I was trying to check in. The apartment itself is fine - as others have mentioned, it felt a bit sterile and could use a deep clean and a couple of small repairs. The hand soap dispenser in the bathroom was empty. Overall this is a perfectly adequate place to stay and much cheaper than the nearby hotels, it just doesn’t necessarily feel “cozy”."

          "comments": "My husband and I booked an eight night stay here and honestly we were uncomfortable. Maybe for two or three nights it would be better. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The TV, although functional, flickered constantly and wasn't usable. There was a washer and dryer but they didn't provide anything to do laundry with which was surprising. There were several items in the room we noticed were broken: a piece of the closet, the luggage rack, and the TV as mentioned. I contacted the host twice. Both times the co-host Basil was responsive, but the information I was given wasn't accurate and they didn't do anything to remedy the TV issue even though we were staying a week. I am giving this place three stars because the location was wonderful and close to a lot of shopping, restaurants, and transit. We also enjoyed the kitchenette which made it easy to cook, although we had to buy all our own spices (including salt and pepper). Despite the location, we wouldn't stay here again."

Compact but smartly organized, with ample storage and a kitchenette stocked with essentials (coffee included—lifesaver!). The bathroom sparkled, and the shower had great pressure. Bonus: fast Wi-Fi and a cozy workspace.  \n**Host shines!** Responsive, friendly, and provided a detailed check in instructions\n**5/5 stars!** Affordable, central, and packed with charm.

The lobby looks “artsy” and cool. A place where the young professionals that live there can brag to their friends about.\nBut if you’re an AirBnB guest, prepare for bare minimum accommodations. \nThe beds have no support. You will sink to the floor and your body will contort like a circus performer. You will wake up in a fog and stiff. \nIt seems the AirBnB hosts are corporate drones that simply are trying to maximize profits by selling you on the rooftop experience and the fact that you are walking distance from everything the city has to offer.\nThat was the only upside. You can truly experience the city but there are far better hotels and deals out there to choose from.\nAlso, this place is not pet or human friendly.\nThey are concerned with pushing to leave them a 5 star review than  actually offer a 5 star experience."

The train noise is legit and goes throughout the night. Maybe bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper and we ran our room AC fan to have some white noise. That helped a lot. Great location and great hosts. We would stay again!"

I LOVE that each room had a vanity and welcome gift which was so thoughtful from the host. I am a clean freak and this place was CLEAN!!!! The kitchen was well stocked with what we needed for our stay and we have to give a shout out to the host for providing extra garbage bags and paper towels/tp  that not all Air BNB hosts stock. The deck was also awesome with comfy seating and the lovely propane fire table we enjoyed.  \nMy only note to future guests: The train noise is REAL and right out of My Cousin Vinny. The host is kind enough to provide earplugs in the welcome gift which were also appreciated, and it does not diminish the quality and beauty of the property but be aware the train is  loud and rolls through all day and night.  My husband laughed every time the train whistle blew he said WILD SCORED!! haha"

The rooms were lovely and comfortable. Only real downside is how loud the train is but we knew to expect that based on the description and it wasn't too bad. We look forward to visiting again when its warm to use the patio and other outdoor perks."

We enjoyed spending time in the Club House as well.\nWish they would have mentioned the square footage, as it was quite a bit smaller than I had expected for a 3 bedroom.  The bedrooms were good size, however, the living space was small."

We knew the trains would be loud and didn’t mind that but there were active water leaks in the bedroom ceiling, the heat was stuck on in the bedroom in 80 degree weather, smoke alarms kept beeping in all units that we couldn’t fix from our unit, the walls are so thin you can hear someone cough in the other units (which was a huge issue when a Bach party was our neighbor into the middle of the night) and there were stains on the couch cushions that were VERY questionable. I tried to bring up my concerns and it was met with ZERO sympathy or resolution. I had to keep checking in and still nothing has been resolved 3 weeks later.. Decorations were very cute though and I wish we could have loved this place."

The biggest inconveniences were outside of Bowen's control and the building staff responsible for handling these issues were congenial and did their best to minimize our inconvenience. The secure included parking is a big plus, just know that the key fob allows you to access parking AND quick access to the building. \nThe kitchen is lightly outfitted, enough for minimal cooking. Not many utensils etc. for food prep, but would allow for some light baking or heating of dishes. \nLots of walkable places nearby. Close to US Bank Stadium. Would absolutely stay here again!"

A small deck for enjoying the city sounds, a lobby with free coffee and a covered parking garage. Bed is comfy, dressing room is large with clothes washer&dryer, full kitchen for cooking and privacy blinds gives full use of this space. Seating is limited and couch not comfortable so plan to bring your own lawn chair. Located on a busy street not far from hospital so you’ll hear plenty of ambulances and traffic. Building is safe and secure and we will stay here again.!"

          "comments": "A pretty nice unit, although some of the finishings are a little odd: the stools at the kitchen island, for example, are too tall to actually sit and eat there. There’s also a light cover missing from the ceiling fan in the bedroom, which is a little jank.\nThe in-unit washer and dryer is nice, and having a responsive smart TV is always a plus. The hot tub is also a big plus, but it is a shared amenity, and so it sometimes hard to use it because others tend to hog it. The communal gym is also nice.\nI think the best thing about this unit is the view of the city, and the connection to the skyway. It’s very easy to get to a lot of different restaurants and other destinations in Minneapolis from here, even when it’s cold out."

Two notes that have nothing to do with the host: the building amenities like the gym and hot tub were open 9am-9pm, which is not convenient during the week, especially for the gym. The other thing is that the parking garage is tight, so make sure you have a compact car!"

I did not use the laundry but when I went to leave and placed used towels in there, it smelled awful. \nmain issue is that it's a poor value for the price and anything extra at all costs extra money. parking, even though an assigned spot is included with the apartment/accessible with the included key fob, is an extra $10/day. check out at 11am instead of 10am is $25 extra, etc. host responds quickly but be sure to read the messages because I did not receive a code for the door to the apartment in my initial welcome message. \noverall, it's fine, but a poor value for the cost."

I really enjoyed my stay here, and I highly recommend booking this place!\nHowever, just a heads up, it can get a bit loud sometimes from the other families living in the building, but you can turn on the AC to cover up the noise. There was also the occasional slight scent of cigarette smoke coming from somewhere."

The studio apartment is very nice and cozy, has a good AC in there to keep you cool in the warmer months. The bed was comfy even for someone like me who needs a good amount of squish. A note, is that the apartment does not currently come with a table for you to eat at. But it does come with a couple of chairs. \nNow for a bit of not so good things, at least from my point of view. The location of the apartment is on the shadier part of town. It felt like I was hanging out around Milwaukee if you're from Wisconsin. The neighborhood itself was kinda filthy with all the garbage floating around the apartment complex. For the few days I was there, there was no shortage of food garbage littered about. And the entry hall for the apartment is very narrow and always had a terrible smell. I want to say it was food, but thankfully that smell didn't get into the apartment.\nOverall I enjoyed my stay and would definitely consider booking another visit using Hamadeh's property."

The unit itself is a (basement) apartment in a Project Housing (HUD) style development. I saw the great price and pictures and booked it for 30days.\nChecking-In:\nROUGH shape buildings and trash around haphazardly between them. suspect looking people in the parking lot, and it smelled like drugs BAD.\nUnit itself was fine, and looked like pics — if you want a cheap stay for a day or two. BUT, I can absolutely NOT recommend this on a monthly basis — the host let me cancel after I explained my disappointment and let him know about the horrid bleach-y chemical smell from both the building itself (basement unit) and the apartment interior bathroom/bedroom. \nOverall, I stayed for two hours and left with a migraine because of how heavy the cleaning fumes were they used. Hamadeh let me cancel, so he gets a star for being solid and understanding I wasn’t feeling safe enough to stay a month."

This location is in an apartment complex - the community at the complex was friendly and family-oriented, which made me feel very safe as a solo female traveler. The unit is secure, and all appliances and living quarters were clean and in working order. I saw in past reviews that some people commented about flies, which are present in the hallway of the complex but are not in the actual unit itself, which is nothing that the host can do anything about, and didn’t affect my stay at all. Hamadeh was very helpful and great with communication whenever I needed anything. Next time I visit the area, I will be staying here again! Thank you Hamadeh for hosting!"

The things that I found off-putting had nothing to do with the host, and are really out of his control, so I do not wish to lessen his rating. But I will include a comment here, as they could be important to others looking to make a decision about where to stay. There was a strong smell of marijuana in the apartment building that leaked into the room, and during our stay there was yelling in the hallways and outside our window. These are obviously things I wouldn't fault the host for, but they definitely made me feel uncomfortable."

Some random things need cleaning and/or repair, but nothing too serious.  Mattresses need to be replaced and have plastic covers.  We would probably look for something slightly nicer in the same area next time, but this would certainly do in a pinch."

The house was super clean and we appreciated everything about it.  It accommodated our needs very well.  This is an inlet off of Mille Lacs Lake so it's not lakeview.  The depth of the water is about 4 feet off of the dock so not swimming friendly.  The inlet is very close to Lake Mille Lacs so easy access for boating or fishing.  There is a great guest house for 2 additional sleep spaces with TV and little frig, not to mention a large garage across the street that is great as a game room with foosball and darts.  We enjoyed our kayak ride from the inlet to the lake.  Mike Fish offered wonderful customer service the entire time we communicated.  Thank you, Mike!"

This cabin had everything that we needed, and was immaculately clean when we arrived!!!\nThe game room was more than bargained for. The amount of games that were available was awesome. We haven't played some of these games (foosball, air hockey) in ages and we had so much fun. The kids especially enjoyed it, they had a blast.\nAccess to the lake was super easy and the firepit was an excellent place to relax and enjoy the sunset!!\nWe will definitely be coming back in the future."

Two bedrooms with queen foam mattresses.  Also has a fold out couch.  Best part was that I had a late flight and the host was very gracious and let me stay over until the afternoon. Way better than waiting at the airport.   A great stay."

Our stay was in February. The reserved parking space in the attached ramp was great on cold and snowy days. Getting to the unit was close and convenient from the parking spot. The queen size bed was so comfortable that we are considering buying one just like it. We did not need to communicate with the owners because everything was as expected. If we did need help, there were many point of access for communication. Emails, text and a refrigerator magnet with all essential numbers."

A couple things weren't perfect, such as the loud construction starting at 0730 weekday mornings, which is out of Minnestay's control, and the ear plugs were a nice touch! The shower was not satisfying, as the water pressure was low and the water didn't get hot enough for my liking... I'm picky about showers, though! The ice maker in the freezer did not work, only made like 4 ice cubes per day. These are, of course, minor complaints, and we really did enjoy our stay! There building was quiet, we didn't hear any neighbors at all, and the parking pass was such a nice perk! We would definitely use Minnestay in the future!"

We were greatful to be in the uptown area and the place provided us a great point of entry into the city. Walking to Uptown was a breeze. Multiple restaurants, thrift shops, and even an Apple store are all in the area. The house is in a very tight knit community so be on your best behavior as to not damage the representation of this fine neighborhood. Multiple people walking dogs, playing outside, and going on runs out front. The walk to Calhoun Lake is also minimal for a great view and exercise opportunities. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Nancy!"

While Minneapolis was a little bit of a random location to choose for our girl's weekend, we had absolutely the most amazing time and a lot was due to our stay at Nancy's place.  \nNancy was extremely responsive from the get go and even provided us with a pack 'n play for the baby (which fits perfectly in the closet, btw, which a was a big win!).  Nancy also provided tons of local tips and was able to help us find everything in Minneapolis that we needed.\nThe place itself is clean and comfortable and in an absolutely perfect location!   We had never been to Minneapolis and we were originally considering staying more downtown, but we are so thankful that we found this place -- it is 2 blocks from the lake, which was amazing for going on walks and enjoying the amazing spring weather.  It is also a few blocks from the Uptown neighborhood with great restaurants, some bars, some shops and a great market - everything we needed was within walking distance.  \nWe also had a rental car and there was street parking and then we joked that everywhere we wanted to go was a 7 minute drive away...other neighborhoods, restaurants, and parks were all easily accessible by car.\nIn the end, the location was a perfect jumping off point for our visit and if any of us go back to Minneapolis, I think we would all want to stay at Nancy's place again.\nHighly recommend this place for any visit to Minneapolis - great location and great host - this is what Air BnB is all about."

We loved being a block away from Lake  Bde Maka Ska. I was worried about off street parking, since I know that area can be very busy, but we had no problem. We were able to park right in front of the house every time. I'm pretty picky, but I had no complaints and would happily stay there again ."

Has more natural light than the downstairs #2 unit as upper units usually do. But the lower one has a lot of light as well! Stay here!! One block from Lake Calhoun, now returned to its original name, Bde Maka Ska, 2 blocks to restaurants and shopping on West  lake street, 3 to LaLa ice cream and other shops on Hennepin. 15 min drive to downtown and airport."

The location is incredible - short walking distance to Lake Calhoun and to many neighborhood coffee shops, restaurants, bistros and markets.  The neighborhood was beautiful and safe.  We have stayed at many Airbnbs and this one by far is at the top of our list.  The only drawback was no dishwasher, but honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal at all.  Especially in light of the other amenities."

She was friendly and available if we needed anything. I highly recommend this place!"

If we need a place to stay for future Minneapolis visits, it will be the first home we'd try to reserve. Thank you, Nancy!"

She was so quick to respond to any questions, she made us freshly baked gluten-free scones, she was just a joy to talk to, spend time with and help us out with anything.  We borrowed a couple bikes and she graciously let us store them in the garage. Honestly, she might be my new favorite person in Minneapolis. The apartment was beautifully decorated (cozy mid-century modern). It was very comfortable for us and our 3-year-old son. We made lots of meals, and it wasn’t a problem not having a dishwasher, it really all worked out just fine. The location was a dream! We walked and biked around the lakes and were so close to so many parks.  This place was the ultimate “score” for our family.  Great restaurants and stores near by made living here very easy and comfortable.  Living in Nancy’s Airbnb for two months in the South Minneapolis area also helped us get very comfortable with a part of town that we now know we want to live in some day, that may not have happened without Nancy’s Airbnb. This is such a fabulous place with a fabulous host, that we hope it’s available this time next summer. We truly feel lucky to have found this gem!!"

She was very responsive and accommodating to our needs allowing us to move furniture around and bring an additional desk, monitor and desk chair. Beyond this she has an incredible energy about her so I highly recommend you chat her up! \nThe apartment was well curated and spacious allowing us to WFH without feeling cramped. It had a fully stocked kitchen with utensils for all your cooking needs, two bedrooms, a large separate dining room, very comfortable living room and tons of closet/ cabinet space for your things if you happen to be nomading like we were or if you’re traveling with a group. There’s also beautiful light that flows through every area of the apartment throughout the day. \nThe location is absolute perfection! We spent most mornings taking a stroll to grab coffee and walk the lake as well as the surrounding blocks. The area feels like a close community that walk their dogs and hang out with their neighbors - a vibe we loved! We were sad to leave and will definitely be back in the future! Thank you Nancy!"

It's what airbnb is all about. A perfect neighborhood location right off the lake that highlights the best of MN and Minneapolis \"the city of lakes\". The home is perfectly appointed with beautiful touches throughout. The style is so cool. Easy parking, super fast wifi, full kitchen, and the list goes on. We're MN natives now living in FL but travel home often and so we can say with authority, stop your search, you've found the best place to stay in the twin cities! We'll be back! Oh, and impulse juice co is 2 blocks away and has the best açaí bowls we've ever had."

This street level flat was spacious, perfectly clean, well furnished and supplied, and has a great layout with living areas in the front and quiet bedrooms in the back. We loved the meticulously restored midcentury bathroom, trim and cabinets. Location is very nice, with the walk around the lake, groceries and uptown commerce, and lots of quiet residences all around. Ideal. While upstairs neighbors were quiet and appropriate, light sleepers might be disturbed by the sounds of feet, creaks, and plumbing. We thought the cleaning fee was a bit steep, but overall this rental is highly recommended!"

The unit itself is the downstairs of a duplex and squeaky clean with gorgeous hardwood floors and the vintage charm of all your grandmother’s home that felt like magic when you were young with modern amenities. It was the perfect jumping off point to explore the city; no where was more than a 15 minute drive. We enjoyed Barbette and Owamni while in town and both were impeccable meals. We enjoyed being close to the lake and some really wonderful coffee spots. The neighborhood felt safe, parking was easy to find. We were also pleased to see so many Pride flag in the neighborhood and it was comforting to know if we needed something Nancy lives next door. She was warm and responsive."

Walking in the area was really not possible for us as we are in our golden years 😉.  But the neighborhood is lovely, and Nancy responded he immediately with somebody who came over and shoveled the sidewalk for us. It's a little bit awkward to have to mow your vehicle twice and not be able to park on the front street because of snow plows... That's not an insurmountable challenge! The house itself is darling, and Nancy has done a swell job with furniture and decorating. There was every single thing we needed in the kitchen and bathroom, and we certainly enjoyed our stay here.. some of my ratings were less than five stars, maybe because although we were told this was a pet friendly Airbnb, once we arrived We went over the owners very detailed instructions that she had left for us, and found out we were not allowed to use the patio with our dog. This was my only complaint/ concern."

I personally loved the music themed decor throughout the house, and Sanna was more than helpful when we had some issues locking up during the day. She even came out when we returned to make sure we got back inside with no issues. My daughter wants to come back to Minneapolis someday and we would definitely book here again! Would also be a great place for a couple’s retreat!"

I was standing in the Minnesota cold for thirty minutes after traveling 4+ hours from the west coast. I had to reach out to Air b n b to get the host's direct contact information. When I texted,  her response was prompt and I was able to get in.\nLater that night, I  went to shower and the hot water ran out after about three minutes. It was late, so I decided to wait to let my host know about the issue. It got fixed when I reported it to her the next day, but it was not a great check in experience to say the least."

I would have felt bad if I had rambunctious kiddos or a baby, but definitely not an issue for our stay at all!  Appreciate all the communication and help for our long stay!"

A laundry mat is a few blocks in the other direction.  Cedar Ave is a busy commuter road, and parking is on the street.  But Minneapolis drivers are used to people waking, biking, blading, etc., and strive to be courteous. \nThe host had flowers and a nice note on the table for me, since I was visiting the city to retrace my steps with my husband and his (our) family during the first anniversary of my husband  “going ahead.”\nThe host kindly made up the trundle bed for my sister in law to stay 2 nights.  \nThe host also had coffee, creamer, tea in the kitchen; and lotion, body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in the bathroom; and a hair dryer in the linen closet. \nI certainly recommend this place!"

As I was getting into town I realized I forgot to bring mine, and thought I’d have to run out and buy one, and was relieved that I could instead just settle in and relax. \nAlso, in a world of soulless gray and white airbnbs decorated with off-the-shelf Walmart art, I appreciate any host that imbues their space with real character. This place is furnished and decorated in a way that fits the style and age of the home, while reflecting the personality of the person who put it together. Staying here feels genuinely comfortable, rather than feeling like just a place to sleep for the night.\nWould highly recommend to anyone checking out the twin city area."

As a family of five, the space was wonderful.  The hosts were so gracious and prepared for our arrival with towels, linens, restaurant and attraction recommendations, and detailed instructions for the house.  Communicating with our hosts was effortless as well.  This was our first experience with airbnb.com and we could not have been more pleased with the outcome."

The mid-town location was ideal in that it was close to shopping, bike trails, and public transportation.

We stayed on a cold winter day, so the heated toilet seat, heated bathroom floor, towel heater, and steam port in the shower were so welcome! The sleep number type bed was very comfortable. The space isn't overly big, but it worked well. Inez has it noted, this is a pull down, Murphy type bed. A very comfortable bed I might add. It is also noted, but their are stairs to get down to the space. There was plenty of parking on the street, we had several spots right in front of the house to choose from, and we have a bigger vehicle. The space is very well decorated, lots of really great games and movies as well. There are a few little spots of unfinished basement peaking out here and there, but with the totally amazing bathroom, great decor, and super comfy bed, we will be back!"

Those things, combined with the friendliness of Inez (your host), this Air B&B has become my go-to spot when I visit the Cities."

We were too tired to take advantage of all the suite's cool puzzles and board games or stroll the charming neighborhood, but hopefully next time. Host was very kind and yet also gave us total privacy. There is a dog living upstairs but it is such a good dog there was zero noise. Parking was easily found. There was tasty coffee supplied- loose grounds not pods. I was very pleased to see many little \"green\" choices like that. And as always we were blown away by how delicious the water is in Twin Cities LOL! Really a perfect experience."

If back in Minneapolis we would rent this home again."

          "comments": "The cottage was clean and convenient.. located a short 8 minute drive from U of M. The layout of the house was a bit unexpected... the main living room had no TV and wasn't set up for relaxation. The downstairs entertainment center was confusing to use and wasn't intuitive for streaming. The bathrooms were updated. The kitchen was well stocked. Overall, it was a solid stay, we just wish the house setup was more conducive for gathering. We also did not hear from the host at all during our stay... to be fair... we didn't need anything. However, it felt odd and when we left i sent a message early in the morning that we were leaving and didn't get a response until many hours later. If you need a clean place to sleep near U of M, book it. If you're looking for a central place to gather with friends and family.... this might be a little tricky for you."

I was also drawn to the fact that I would have a house for myself and my guests vs. sharing.\nThe house is very clean, the furnishings comfortable, inviting and there are touches of fun art pieces that adds to the overall charm. Wi-Fi easily accessed and functional, big screen TV and video games in the lower level. Laundry facilities, two full bathrooms.\nI was pleasantly surprised over how the house was stocked with anything a renter could possibly want or need from birthday candles to books and games, tea and LaCroix, a solidly stocked kitchen allowing people to prepare any kind of dish imaginable if they want to cook.  Restaurants in the neighborhood you can walk to.\nW"

The neighborhood is friendly and quiet and close to everything we needed.\nThe host was awesome and very responsive. She helped us when we needed it and felt like she cared about our family.\nThe only downside is that because we stayed for almost 2 months, there wasn’t much space for all of our clothes. There weren’t any dressers, just closets, so that’s something to consider if you need extra clothes space.\nOtherwise, everything was just what we needed, and more! We made good use of the yard games provided and the kids loved the bunk bed and piano as well."

We were there over Christmas and New Years, and when we had 2 big snowstorms in a row. Karina was at the house early in the morning and had everything shoveled and made sure to text to let us know she was coming. We had a few questions and she was quick to respond and so, so friendly! We did get to meet the neighbors in the area due to the snowstorms as we all worked together to dig people out (all of the neighbors were warm and welcoming) and my sons helped clear the ends of the alley to make it easier for everyone to get in and out. \nWe were able to explore the area try out new restaurants and stores. We had a great experience and it was a wonderful interim place between houses. I'm so happy we chose this home and you will be too! Thank you Karina!"

Very bikeable and walkable. This is a quiet residential neighborhood and felt quite safe. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. It's about 15 minutes from the U of M and 20 minutes from either downtown. There is a nice shaded lawn and patio. There is an elementary school with a good playground a block away, and a welcoming Lutheran church two blocks away. \nThere is a washer and dryer which we found very helpful. We also had use of the garage for our car and bike.  \nThe kitchen was well-equipped and Karina generously left us some food which was very welcome since we arrived quite late the first night. Karina was very responsive to all our needs. \nWe were very happy with both our stays and would highly recommend this Airbnb."

The neighbourhood is quiet, but quite central. \nThey have a piano and loads of political philosophy books if you want to revisit your undergrad days. \nWould stay with again."

They were very welcoming, and very prepared for accommodating guests. We were in Saint Paul for a concert, and when we realized last minute that we needed to print off our tickets they went above and beyond to help us. Although we declined, they offered us both dinner once we arrived at their home and breakfast before we left in the morning. They were also eager to give us tips for restaurants and directions to our concert venue. \r\nTheir house is amazing! It is clear they've put a ton of work into making it their home. The decor was very on trend, and made their home even more lovely. Not to mention, it was spotless. Due to some repainting in their guest room, we had to stay in a different room, which they gave us at a discounted rate, but it was honestly worth the original rate- if not more! It's also in a great location- we were able to walk to the concert venue, which was at the Xcel Energy Center. It's also a very short walk to the Green Line, which runs all throughout Saint Paul."

Not to mention, their house was absolutely gorgeous and conveniently located! I would recommend them highly, to anyone who is staying in the Twin Cities area!"

I was very touched by all the little details of my stay. I felt like I was at a Bed and Breakfast. The room I  stayed in was very cozy and clean. My towels were carefully folded in a basket with ribbon... like they were a present waiting for me. They even have an automatic water heater and assorted teas to chose from in the bedroom. There is a wide driveway in which  to park your vehicle. Hannah even made me coffee and offered me cereal and a banana when I woke up in the morning! These two are so welcoming, I felt right at home."

They always respond quickly whether you text them before you get there or if you need anything when you are there (and they are out and about).\r\nThere have a driveway where you can park off street, and you can even see your car from your bedroom window.\r\nTheir home is a few minutes walk from the light rail and bus stops.\r\nI stayed for a week, and every day was a pleasure to be there in their gorgeous home. \r\nEvery room is clean and nicely furnished. The large kitchen is modern. Plus they have a mini fridge (in the kitchen) just for you. It is stocked with bottled water, soda, eggs and cereal, plus plenty of space for your items that need to be refrigerated. \r\nIt is a little steep going up and down the stairs to the 2nd floor. But that little effort is definitely worth reaching the spacious bedroom upstairs. It has a large closet, a comfy chair, a dresser, and next to the very comfortable bed is a neatly lettered large card with their wifi and emergency info plus each of their phone numbers. The ceiling fan in the bedroom is great when it gets warm (there is no air conditioning), and there are two other fans available, too (a little portable fan and a window box fan). Lots of good books to read, too!\r\nIn the basement, there is a washer, dryer and full refrigerator (with freezer) for you to use."

The house and lot are beautiful, veryclean and extremely well maintained.  They expressed genuine interest in me and it was great to get to know them.  Access to great St. Paul point of interest is a stone's throw away and they are very helpful with recommendations."

We enjoyed the conversation over tea & coffee, and also being able to use a great kitchen after some time car camping. The guest fridge is an especially nice feature which we put to good use. Love the space, artwork, and the occasional subtle sci-fi references.\r\n\r\nFor potential guests, we enjoy a walkable location and made use of the home's closeness to downtown St. Paul as well as the metro, which we took to Minneapolis for a day of exploring ($2.25 for a 2.5hr pass). Check-in was well coordinated and we met in person for the key handoff. Hannah & Richard are very personable hosts, and highly recommended. Enjoy!"

The room and house are beautifully decorated with many amenities - comfortable bed, tea and an electronic kettle, ample outlets for plugging in electronics. The hosts were great communicators - helpful and friendly. They gave me a plethora of restaurant recommendations (thank you, again!) and were happy to chat, but understanding when I retreated to my room. I would definitely stay again!"

Lovely hosts. \r\n\r\nEverywhere you look in the house you can spot a little detail that reveals Hannah and Richard's creativity and care in creating a pleasant air bnb experience -- from the ribbon tied towels to the hand written calligraphy info card, to the tea station in the room. \r\n\r\nWhen I booked the room, air bnb said I was lucky because it's usually booked. I can see why!! \r\n\r\nKeep it up guys, you are doing an awesome job!!"

I felt like I was visiting long-time friends, rather than staying in a stranger's house.\r\n\r\nTheir home is in close proximity to a variety of great restaurants and places to visit. I had no trouble walking, taking the metro train, or catching a lyft anywhere I needed to go. \r\n\r\nThis lovely couple turned what is normally a boring business trip into a wonderful memory. After staying with them for two days, I dragged my feet about having to leave, even though I was departing to visit a city I love! I would absolutely stay with them again the next time I visit St. Paul!"

The couple communicated with me before my booking to help me learn the system and answer a couple of questions I had. I had quite a full agenda for my first visit to the Twin Cities, so I wasn't able to enjoy all the nice amenities they had, but they have definitely set it up to make it feel like \"home away from home\". Comfy bed, too! As I said, I lucked out and I'm so grateful!"

Answered all of our questions and even made their mini fridge available for our use! They were a very humble and down to earth couple. Really enjoyed hanging out with them in the evening. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quite and cozy place while in the St. Paul area!"

I slept comfortably and soundly through the beeping of my alarm clock!  \nBesides an ample-sized bed tastefully made of fresh and clean bedding – topped up with a handful of “just the right size” pillows, my room was furnished with an inviting upholstered chair, a nearby reading lamp, desk, a decent-sized dresser, and a supply of books neatly displayed on a wood-frame bookshelf.  Inside the closet I found a small collection of terry robes and a few pairs of house slippers (Asian-style hospitality), plus a good supply of empty hangers.        \nWhen I arrived, Richard carried my suitcase into the house before giving me a quick tour of the place and basic house instructions.  \nBoth Hannah and Richard were very friendly and hospitable, and their house was very clean, orderly, and inviting.  Located just blocks from the Minnesota State Capitol and within walking distance of downtown St. Paul, you won’t find a more pleasant and affordable place to stay than here."

They were very accommodating and communicative before check in.  I found my way to their home via the Metro Transit stop (public transportation here is amazing!), and would have walked around everywhere I needed to go except that I was wearing heels for the majority of my stay, so I just ubered.  The home itself is very quaint and still has a good portion of the original floors and exposed wood trim.  The room is quite large and has one of the most comfortable beds!  I had to ask what mattress they use.  I had ample space to sprawl out all my things and they have closet space as well for anything that you may need to hang.  Though their description mentioned that the street noise can become lively at certain hours, I didn't experience much noise at all.  In fact, due to the season, they kept many of the windows open and it was a nice change to hear the outside and get some fresh air.  The bathroom was also very spacious and clean, and included a claw foot tub!  Though most of my weekend activities and meals were planned for me, I can recommend eating at Keys Cafe (walking distance) or Nina's Cafe (short drive, but worth it, and also recommended by Hannah).  I would absolutely recommend staying at Richard and Hannah's home if you're in the area; I know I'll be back if my travels bring me back to St. Paul!  They are wonderful hosts!"

The house is also within walking distance of the light rail station, the Capitol building, and numerous great places to eat. Would definitely recommend."

We didn't spend much time there because we were visiting our daughter who lives in St. Paul and exploring the Twin Cities, but the bed was super comfy and the house's location is terrific.  Only thing to note to other guests is that the stairway is narrow and it might be hard to get a huge suitcase up to the 2nd floor bedroom. This was not a problem for us but if you have a huge bag, this might be an issue. Richard offered to take our bags up for us but we were traveling light so we didn't need his kind offer of help.  Great place, friendly and welcoming hosts, nice location close to downtown St. Paul."

They provided as much or as little interaction you wish to have during your stay with them.\nA warm and friendly household from a very caring couple. I would highly recommend Hannah and Richard to anyone planning a trip to the Twin Cities."

The room was large and comfortable, the kitchen was pleasant and I had my own mini fridge containing treats. Pleasant neighborhood just a few blocks from a Green Line stop so it was easy to get around. The weather was a little colder than I had clothes for, and Hannah was kind enough to lend me a scarf. Only caveat is the steep stairs to the second floor, so anyone with mobility issues should beware. I would stay here again. Heck, I'd move in if I could! This was a really nice stay."

While their place is excellent, Hannah and Richard are the real draw here. I have rarely meet such warm, genuine, and welcoming people. It was a pleasure to get to meet their family and share in their hospitality."

Hannah and Richard were very considerate as the weather became snowy, they kindly lent me some winter footwear.

Hannah and Richard were very fast to respond to all questions right from the beginning of our reservation, making it easy to iron out details since members of our party got in at different times. We very much appreciate their flexibility in accommodating early arrivals for some members of our party—thank you so, so much again! \nIn short, we had a pampered stay in a great house  while exploring a fun city!"

I am always very happy when I am under-promised and over delivered. The things that I was not expecting were some if the things I needed the most. for example, my daughter forgot her toothbrush and we found that there was a small stash of them in the upstairs bathroom. Not that these things will always be there for every guest but I think they just keep some things they know could be useful for anybody. The house was very spacious and spread out. Lots if places to retreat if you wanted to have some time alone. The deck overlooking the backyard was very comforting as a place to get some air and relax. There is also a big back yard & front porch. They have some games and things to do as a family or a group. The kitchen was great! we spent a lot of time in the kitchen, it reminded me so much of the house I grew up in. Everything is organized very conveniently. There was a pleasant spell of eucalyptus in some places, which I really loved. Everything was clean! There was lots of natural lighting. I was very happy during out stay, this hostis the best and has set the bar extremely high! I have NO COMPLAINTS!"

We stayed here Jan through Feb 2022 after our St. Paul house sold and we prepared to move out of state for my husband’s new job. \nThe kitchen and dining room have everything you need to spend hours cooking, eating and playing board games.\nThe house is also in a very central location to access both of the twin cities. A great grocery store is also less than a mile away.\nWe also easily settled in to work remote from this house. Excellent WiFi and tons of space on the two floors.\nBest,\nJen"

Highly recommend this beautiful accommodation!"

The rooms were comfortable and spacious, the kitchen equipped for basic meals - vegetable oil, salt and other basic spices, pots and pans, plates, etc (including a starter carton of eggs, a 1/2 gallon of milk, half & half, coffee and cereal!). \nIt's walking distance to a great grocery store (Lunds and Byerlys), the metro's green line to get to other spots in St. Paul (Fasika Ethiopian food and three floors at Midway used books on Snelling!) and downtown Minneapolis (Mary Tyler Moore statue at Nicollett Mall! Bob Dylan mural! Target Field!), and a Hmong market in the other direction for some great pho and other delights. \nAnd it's convenient to the Twin Cities' tangle of highways while being tucked away from the noise. \nThe two porches were perfect for morning coffee. \nRichard was highly responsive, within minutes, whenever I had a question. I can't wait to return to this home!"

Beautifully decorated, quiet, great towels, a huge TV, and a garage (great for Minnesota in the winter!)  I really liked all the little touches in the kitchenette like sandwich bags, scissors, and a pen.  \nLynnell responded quickly to any questions and the keypad entry was easy.\nI would definitely stay again if I was in the area."

Lynnell was very prompt in responding when we needed a response. We'd definitely look to stay there again when we're in the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. Just a warning for coffee-drinkers, they supply hot chocolate mix but no coffee. Not a great hardship for most people but it was different than any other Airbnb we've stayed at in the past."

It was sparkling clean and you could tell she had taken great care to make the place very comfortable and welcoming. There was a problem with the garage door opener when we needed to leave one night but she was very quick to respond to us, get it figured out, and we didn’t have an issue with it for the rest of the trip. Lynnell was so helpful and consistently checked in on us to make sure everything was going okay and if we had questions. All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

We were close enough to the city to get everywhere we wanted to in under 30 minutes, yet far enough way to not have any city noise, traffic, or distractions. The private garage was an added bonus! 10/10 would recommend! Clean, relaxing, comfortable. The perfect spot for a kid-free weekend getaway. Also, this is located five minutes away from a hidden tourist gem; Coon Rapids Dam. Easy access to the MS River and a walkable dam. \nThank you, Lynnell!"

It was so nice that Lynnell offers single night stays.  The location was quiet and safe, and the studio was very clean and stylish. Both the bed and the pull out were very comfortable.  There were brochures and travel guides to look through, so we did not even turn on the TV. And the check in and check out procedures were easy to understand. If I could rate this higher than a 10, I would!!"

Great communication and the place was SPARKLING CLEAN! The shower was one of my favorite parts! Definitely in a secluded area, but close to everything you need! I will definitely return someday!"

The studio was really clean, cozy, and it was a lovely place to relax after watching Ultimate all day.  At first,  I was not too sure about not having a full kitchen but at the end, it worked out great. We went to Whole Foods every 2.5 days to grab some deli food that we would keep in the fridge and warm in the microwave.  We met Lynnell who is really nice and really responsive with her emails. I highly recommend you consider her place if you are going to Blaine or even Minneapolis as it is really not that far to reach the city."

It was clean, comfortable, pleasantly furnished, and felt very cozy. \nThe neighborhood is very close to Downtown Anoka which is a charming little town and although I didn't make use of them, I thought I saw some trails for hiking or biking.  Very easy highway access. There is a small gas station  and neighborhood convenience store a short walk away too which came in super handy to purchase some bread, coffee, cream, and toiletries. \nLynnell thanks so much!"

Hosts messaged me to ask how I was doing.\nI appreciated their willingness to  share information, as I am new to Minnesota and this was my first time visiting.  My purpose was to check out real estate and I wanted to speak to people who had come from elsewhere and made Minnesota home.  My hosts were very open about their experiences and took the time to engage with me by phone and in person.\nI feel fortunate to have had such a positive experience!"

There was a bit of an annoying humming sound (suspect the baseboard heaters) that kept us awake at times.  Checkin was a little confusing at first perhaps because we thought Lynnell lived in the main part of the house so when 2 parties showed up at the rental, there was a little confusion.  Instructions on how to get in were good.  I blame myself for not reading them closely before arriving."

My wife on the other hand thought that there wasn't a problem with either the couch or the bed. So take that information as you'd like. Other than that, the location was perfect. The host was very nice and responsive and the place was nice and cozy! If you want just a comfortable vacation get away for yourself or with a spouse, I highly recommend this place. I also really love the extra security of only having access to the room through the garage."

It was perfect for what we needed for a long weekend."

Comfortably slept 6, but could have ha sled more with ease.  The amenities were areaome.  Other BnB owners will need to really step it up to exceed this experience.  Worth every penny and yet, so much less expensive than a hotel for six."

Lovely neighborhood for walks too.\nWe will certainly be staying at The Cottage again in the future."

We were not able to explore the neighborhood because we had a specific itinerary for our trip, but what we did see made us wish we had more time to explore. Coffee close enough to walk as well as several other establishments. Close to Mall of America. All amenities needed were there and plenty of room for our six travelers including teenagers. Not much down time for us, but they have several board games the teens played that was an unexpected touch.  Really enjoyed our short stay and would love to stay again and relax! Great place!"

We could not have found a more perfect location! We made a huge feast using the extremely well stocked kitchen that did not lack any kitchen utensils needed. We had originally planned on buying plates for the dinner but were pleasantly surprised to find over 30 pretty glass plates for us to use along with more than enough silverware. The basement was the perfect spot to hangout and play some of the many games that were at the house while keeping warm by the fireplace. We would reccomend the location in the future and appreciated our host’s communication and hospitality."

Everything was absolutely spotless, and furnished with everything we needed, from towels, sheets and linens, to every kitchen utensil one would ever need. And that's not even mentioning the tropical like gardens, patio, shady pergola with table and chairs, and flowers abundant!  The location was also amazing! Portland south took us to Crosstown Hwy #62 where we could go west, to the Arboretum, east to St Paul to go on our riverboat cruise,straight  onto 35W south to go out of town, or 1 block over to Park, to head downtown to Stella's Fish Cafe rooftop for a wonderful evening. So convenient! The owner is available, friendly, and made us feel so welcome and at home! I couldn't recommend this more highly. The perfect get away! Thank you Alex and Brie!"

Be sure to come at harvest time and you will enjoy fresh herbs, peppers, squash and other hidden delights. Alex is a warm and welcoming host. We felt cared for but never intruded upon. He has a supportive and generous spirit. We recommend staying here when you are in Minneapolis."

This house is next door to the owner's residence and your first impression will be to be overwhelmed by the gardens, front, side, and back.  Alex, the owner, is straight-forward and friendly and I personally greatly enjoyed talking with him.  We need more people like Alex.  The house itself was very very comfortable with all expected amenities.  Everything worked.  It was clean and very comfortable.  The decor of the den, in particular, was unusually comfortable.  This is not to say the rest of the house was not comfortable - it was.  At night, it was quiet.  The airport is perhaps 15-20 minutes away.  The location for us was perfect.  Simply put, this was a great place for us to stay for a week.  You will not be disappointed, and if for some reason you're in a bad mood, the gardens will put you right, every day."

Bree and Alex were great hosts and made us feel welcome throughout our entire visit, and the chickens were friendly and entertaining!"

Bathrooms were small and not clean. The main level bath didn’t have a lock. Basement has no heating. And way to basement is from kitchen. Very narrow small staircase, (step is smaller than length of the foot) \nCobwebs in Places and the whole front door covered in cobwebs \nNo garbage disposer in sink. Sink in laundry room filthy dirty. Fireplace in basement wasn’t working and no heating so couldn’t use the basement. The fireplace in main lever was fixed on the day fifth of our stay."

Bath time for my kids was a bit difficult because the bath tub didn't fill up very fast. The beds were comfortable. There were no locks on any doors. The biggest issue during the stay was the smell coming from the basement because there was some carpet cleaning done, however there was hardly any ventilation so it began to stink of mold or mildew. Alex was very kind and he did give us a discount. Otherwise, the place was very cozy and fun to stay and an excellent location. We had a great time."

From a reading room with a large window with a view to the chicken coop, which was the coolest ever! To the well setup living room and bedrooms. The fireplace downstairs was very inviting to the multiple choices for bath soaps, they had it all!! I still can’t get over the cool chicken coop, the chickens were so friendly and not loud. They sounded like cat purrs when you walked up to the fence lol. Lastly, this location is very accessible to everything, I’d give them a look if you are coming to Minneapolis, we will look them up next year. \nThank you, from our family to yours, this was the home we needed given the reason we came to visit."

Kitchen is available as well as laundry facilities, coffee, den, and dining room. Everyone was quiet and respectful, such a peaceful setting.\nExceptional location just north of 38th which is an amazing street to explore for food. I could walk to the light rail, bus 23 is very convenient if you don’t want to walk. Host was gracious and kind, Internet was rocking. The perfect stay. \nNo TVs in the bedrooms, but I like that. Some people don’t, that’s why I mentioned it. Always best to manage your expectations. This is a peaceful, respectful, safe setting."

Megan did not communicate with us at all outside of her automated messages. I messaged her days before our stay, many times on different platforms trying to get an early check in (which was listed as an option on her automated message) with no response. Very disappointed in the lack of communication. Another thing that was very disappointing to us is that this room is supposedly “bourbon” themed, with the description, “Whether you’re preparing a quick snack or a gourmet cocktail, you’ll find everything you need at your fingertips.” There are also multiple photos of full bourbon bottles on the listing which gave us the assumption these could be used by guests. When we arrived, they were all completely empty. There are absolutely no supplies to make a “gourmet cocktail” outside of a few pieces of old ice in the freezer."

We would definitely stay again. \nHowever there were a few things that weren’t major issues but would have been nice to know ahead of time. 1)the Arkansas room is VERY close to, basically shares parking with a restaurant/bar. That being said, although we were worried about noise, we didn’t hear a thing even though it seemed very busy one night. 2) Internet was pretty spotty. 3) There is no closet space. Not a huge deal but a couple extra hooks somewhere in the room would have been super helpful. \nAgain none of these things are deal breakers, we had a fantastic stay, but just a heads up😊"

It was all we needed, and the restaurant next door provided delicious menu options! We didn't have any issues with noise coming from the restaurant or traffic nearby. We felt very comfortable here.\nThere are local eateries very close by with good food/drink options. Next time we come we will come earlier to walk into the main drag and visit the local shops (these didn't pop up on the map for me during my planning stage, so we were unaware that there were shops nearby!).\nWe did notice that the water takes a really long time to turn warm/hot, so initially we were concerned that it was a one heater establishment and it ran out, but it just needed a good 5ish minutes to run until it got warm/hot.\nWe would definitely return. Megan and her team have really done amazing things with this place and the theme of different states! Thank you!"

We always had a space so really it was no issue.  \nOverall, it turned out to be a great time for us and we really enjoyed ourselves."

There was road construction that made it a bit hard to find (some road signs were down), which wasn't the host's fault, but it's good to know this ahead of time.  Google maps got me there."

We were a group of 4 (was supposed to be 6 but two friends got hit with covid right before the trip) so the house was especially spacious but I think it would've been very comfortable still with all six of us there. The living room is huge and was a great place to hang out. We loved the enclosed patio too. One note about the dock access -- it's a pretty small little dock and covered in duck poop, so not great for hanging out at like we were hoping. Was still a nice spot to take out the paddleboards from though. Would definitely stay here again!"

Once we arrived, we were astonished at the ambiance and decor. The quaint yet spacious lake house was exactly what our family was looking. The contemporary decor was done tastefully and provided an inviting and spacious open concept. The beds (mattresses) were better than the ones we had at home! Lol The bathrooms and kitchen were updated and more important CLEAN. It smelled great and there was even an enclosed porch with a fire pit! I couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. We even decided to stay longer because we were so comfortable. The washer and dryer, the towels provided, the cleaning supplies, and the spacious garage all made us feel at home while away from home. The host even asked me if i needed anything and honored our request for sugar free liquid creamer! I took the time to write this 5 star review!! We will be back!"

          "comments": "This place was cute and just the right size for what we needed. I did have to reach out to the host for instructions on how to enter the property once we arrived because I never received them after check in time. For the most part the place was well kept, but it was lacking quite a bit in the way of kitchen utensils and cooking supplies. We found there was garbage and food under the couch from previous guests. Then we started to have an issue with ants. They came in under the baseboards in the master bath. We found some ant traps in the closet and used those, but eventually had to buy ant killing spray to take care of it. We occasionally found them in the kitchen as well. The grill needs a major update. The cooking grate was very rusty. We had to put foil down first to cook our burgers. Otherwise, we did have a good stay. We really enjoyed the kayaks on Orono Lake. It was nice to have that so close by. Ellie was very attentive and quick to respond."

(No measuring cups, small number of full size plates and glasses, small fry pan, etc.) \nAlso the dock and lake access is located down the block but there wasn’t any information given when we checked in as to where the access was. We walked around for awhile before we found it. If you like to sit on the dock, note that there is no bench or chairs  so may want to pack camping chairs to take with you. We enjoyed swimming and kayaking and traveled to the beach across the lake which was very nice. Overall, it was a nice experience for our family."

Multiple gathering spaces allowed for the much cherished time to hang out, play games, and keep our toddler in sight with the open design. Beds were comfy. Very rejuvenating time together. \nMade use of the kayaks and paddle boards. Lake has easy access a short walk to a shared dock down a few stairs. Helpful to have a nearby store for groceries and coffee shop. \nVery warm and responsive communications with Ellie! Would highly recommend!"

She was very personable and reached out often throughout our stay. The house and beds were extremely comfortable and we felt safe. However, the Airbnb was poorly stocked- we had to go out and buy more toilet paper, no extra blankets, very minimal cooking supplies or simple seasonings like salt. The doors on the bedrooms and bathrooms are missing locks. We also felt like we had to do a lot of cleaning after being charged a significant cleaning fee. Overall good experience, would recommend the home & the area, but hopefully is more prepared for the next guests."

The view of the lake was beautiful and ease of getting to the beach area across the lake were very convenient. The openness of the living room/kitchen/dining area made it easy for relaxing and eating. The kitchen was amply stocked with dishes/cookware, etc., and even some condiments if needed.\nBathrooms were clean and well supplied with linens. My favorite spot was the screened-in porch...just to relax and view the lake. (And watch the little chipmunk and rabbit that came up on the deck outside!)\nOur host was quick to respond to our questions, which was greatly appreciated.\nWe were familiar with the area, having grown up nearby, so getting around was simple. Access to stores and restaurants was easy and plenty of them. \nIf we were to visit the area again, this house would definitely be one of our choices."

The property backs up on woods with huge oak trees, and her whole property is surrounded by rolling farmland, including small farms with sheep and horses. \nThe house is spacious, but the bedroom we were in felt slightly snug with two adults and our clothes, books, etc. It might feel a little closed in for guests who are inclined to keep to their room, but then they'd miss out on the heavenly second floor screened porch, serene living room, gardens, and other common spaces! Next to the bedroom is a very clean and roomy bathroom and laundry area, with counter space and a full sized fridge we were free to use—a big plus.\nOn top of all that Jayne is a kind, generous, good-humored host. I highly recommend this getaway! THANKS, JAYNE!"

It's one of my favorite aspects of the house. Guests have access to nearly the whole house -  kitchen, living room, sitting room and more. The roomd are very comfortable  and  aesthetically pleasing. Be sure to ask to buy fresh eggs from her chickens for a good breakfast! The Minnesota River Valley is a beautiful area  just a few minutes away. Jayne is a lovely host! I hope to return again."

This was a much better value – the bedroom was clean, comfortable, and quiet; the bathroom was spotless and big too, and just a few steps from the bedroom. Jayne was a great hostess who went the extra mile with extras: coffee, fridge, easy come-and-go access. I really think this is what it looks like when an Airbnb rental does it right: plenty private but we still had personal access to the host when we needed it. I highly recommend it."

With the autumn leaves changing, the dried corn stalks and the red barns dotting the landscape, her beautiful yellow home and its location was something right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Our room was in the lower level--which isn't usually my favorite--but this was well-appointed, quiet, clean and comfortable and came with our own bathroom, full-sized fridge, microwave and Keurig. We stayed with Jayne to attend the Minnesota Renaissance Festival (conveniently 20 min away), but it would be a lovely place for a couple's retreat, too. Can't recommend it highly enough!"

She is extremely personable, welcoming and friendly but not the least bit intrusive or invasive. The space was very private and larger than I expected. The laundry room was a huge bonus as my stay was so long and I had a child with me. Coffee and Keurig, bottled water provided, which was a nice touch.  I am quite picky but I must say her home was perfectly clean, with good quality towels and soft linens and I had zero complaints.  It is in the country so expect a VERY quiet environment surrounded by gorgeous gardens and flowers. I saw hummingbirds every day on the patio, which was a real treat!"

Jayne's space provided me with an open country feel with an easy 20 minute into Excelsior.  My GPS easily found Jayne's beautiful home.  The bedroom is in the lower level; providing a dark and quiet space for a restful sleep.  The room is  comfortably furnished w refurbished antiques and its own bathroom with shower and kitchenette area.  Jayne's space was spic-and-span clean, neat and ordered - it was wonderful!  I enjoyed time on the large porch surrounded by well manicured and blooming gardens .  I stayed for just a night on this trip and look forward to a longer stay in the future.  Jayne was exceptionally friendly, accommodating (as I asked and was granted an early check in) and delightful!  THANK you Jayne :-)"

Le lieu est calme, paisible, un véritable havre de paix à quelques minutes en voiture de Minneapolis. Nous avons pu profiter du porche et du jardin pour nous ressourcer, il y a de magnifiques promenades et randonnées aux environs pour profiter de la nature. Jayne est d’une gentillesse incroyable, c’est un plaisir de discuter avec elle et d’échanger, moi qui aime discuter avec les hôtes et échanger nos expériences.\nLe logement était plus que parfait, confortable, Jayne pense à tout pour que le séjour soit agréable et qu’on ne manque de rien.\nJ’ai envie de revenir dans le Minnesota juste pour passer quelques jours de plus chez Jayne."

I was there to visit my niece and her family who live in Chaska and nearby.\n    Jayne gave me a lot privacy but was available if I needed information.  We took a walk around her beautiful garden, and one night sat on her front porch and chatted while rocking in rocking chairs.  She anticipated my needs but didn't force anything.  \n     My bed was very comfortable, and there were convenient drawers and electrical sockets.  The area for coffee was large with a refrigerator and microwave and a couple of counters.  The bath had great fluffy towels and was very clean.  \n     The cost was very reasonable for all that was provided.  Jaye works hard to make the guests feel at home and comfortable.  I will stay there again when I am in the area."

The lights in the bedroom were perfectly dim to set the mood to wind down at the end of the day. Loved the small touch of chocolates and the natural light upstairs is wonderful! Wish I could have stayed for another day with no plans other than enjoying the peace of the area. Recommend for anyone looking to have an entire downstairs to themselves in a cozy environment!"

Tang Tang was extremely helpful, showing me the way to the Univ. area which I had to go to several times over two days.  My continental breakfast was cooked up and served in an orderly & expeditious manner at the forewarned early time of around 8:00 a.m.  It was perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nI would recommend the place and the people managing it to anyone interested in my opinion."

Bath right outside bedroom door! Located in pretty, and convenient part of town, Richfield. Loads of shopping, restaurants, and cafes close by. Walking distance to a park/lake called Wood Lake. Nice walking/running trail around lake through the woods. Really enjoyed my stay here, I would definitely recommend, and stay again! Thanks Tang! Sincerely, Bruce"

A colleague of mine and I were attending a three day intensive training at Bloomington Embassy Suites, just a few miles away. It was very restful to return to quiet but cheerful, home to rest and prepare for the next day. I would recommend this airbnb residence without qualification. I thank Tang and her family very much."

Great place to just walk around if you're waiting to get picked up or if you just want to explore. Tang's Uncle & Aunt who live in the house were very joyful and hospitable even though there was a language barrier. We were able to communicate well with just the basics. They really give you your space and let you do your own thing. They provided cereal and tea for breakfast. The Aunt and Uncle asked if I was cold at night and I told them it was. They immediately adjusted the temperature in the house. You can make the adjustment yourself which is located right outside the room."

          "comments": "So-called \"Beautiful House\" looks nothing like the photo.  It's in a lower-middle class suburb of Minneapolis called Richfield.   The home was cluttered, with a Fisher Price pool table in the living room and some odds and ends on the dining room table. I never actually met Tang Tang, just an older couple who did not speak English.  The room was a small bedroom, clean and neat.  However, the bed was hard as a rock.  Our bathroom tub's finish was worn down and looked grimy. At 1:45 am, someone started running the washing machine downstairs. The tumbling of the machine was so loud it woke up both my husband and me, and kept running for an hour.  Needless to say, we did not get any sleep that night.  The next morning, there was no indication of what breakfast was supposed to be, although there was a box of corn flakes, a bowl full or oranges, and a container of instant coffee on the dining room table.  There was no note about anything, just those two older people who seemed nice, but who spoke no English.  We left after one night, even though we paid for five."

She was not responsive.\r\nOn the days leading up to my visit, she would not reply to my texts or answer my phone calls or Airbnb messages. She did it eventually. But it took me several attempts to get to her and the delay made me worry. \r\n\r\n2. She did not communicate our needs to her aunt and uncle. \r\nThe day before, I told Tang what time I would be there. When we got to the house, no one was home. My sister and I waited outside for nearly 30 minutes, which shouldn't have happened if she had at least told us ahead of time that no one would be there.\r\n\r\n3. She over-promised. \r\nShe stated in her description that airport pickups, rides, and breakfast were included. That did not happen and she did not compensate for it. Every morning we only saw a container with cereal and crackers on the table and I had told her twice that I had special dietary needs. The place she listed is fine. Not as clean or beautiful as she made it seem. \r\n\r\nIf she can get her act together, your visit will be a lot better and less worrisome."

We were told laundry was ok to do but we finished two loads and where told 10.00 more for any other loads. the place is nice and quite as well we for the most part enjoyed our two weeks here. The aunt and uncle who live there did go into the room a few times we where not there to open our windows and empty the garbage I felt uncomfortable about this but I also didn't lock the door with the key they gave us  so my own fault as well. ( I want to note I don't think their intentions where anything other then good.) the bus line was close. Their are many shops in the area.We cooked most our own meals there the  however it is difficult at time to know what to expect from the uncle and aunt. One of the times they asked we cook in the garage for a beef roast I made still not sure what that was about. They have stuff in the kitchen you can use and some you cant by way of dishes and cookware. The meals in the ad are no longer being served. I read the reviews from prior so I was aware of this but the ad hasn't changed as of this time. Never did meet Tang. Those that i did meet where all pleasant. I do however think that the aunt and uncle who live there are not happy with having the home invaded by renters from time to time just my perception I could be wrong. There was also a renter in the basement who didn't seem to like others in the house but didn't see her often. Overall I think it was a good stay and I would return.   (P.S. Writing down things will help with talking to aunt and uncle.    They read better then understand spoken English.)"

Mr. and Mrs. Huang were excellent hosts at Tang's house. Another person who lived at the house translated for them since they only spoke Chinese. Mr. Huang was very good at explaining everything. He got me in contact with a relative in China who was in my field of study. Mrs. Huang made me feel very welcome. She showed me how to make sticky rice balls. \r\nThe house and room were clean. A refrigerator was provided in my room of stay, along with a desk. I had a key for this room. The location of the house was very convenient for me in attending a conference, the Mall of America and other sites. There were restaurants within 2 miles. \r\nOverall, it was an excellent cultural experience visiting this home and I'm glad that I could stay there. Mrs. Huang invited me to come back. Staying at this AirBNB house enhanced my visit of Minnesota.\r\nThank you, Tang Tang!"

The actual occupants of the house are an elderly couple who have slight difficulty communicating in English, but have outstanding hospitality and are genuinely one of the nicest people I've met. Communicating with Tang should be done through phone or text since she doesn't respond to messages within Airbnb. Had slight trouble during check-in process as no one was home, but the stay overall was very worth it. Would recommend!"

House has 3 bedrooms and 1.5 bathrooms upstairs with a full bathroom and bedroom downstairs. Beware if you are tall the down stairs bathroom has low ceilings. Beds were advertised as queen beds but they are not queen beds they are all full beds. Upstairs bathroom has grab rails in the shower as well as the wall. They are not secured and would not hold you up if you fell they will come out of the wall so if you are elderly beware. Those are the only two cons to the house the stay was pleasant and would stay there again."

The house was tidy - but small details were missed - there was a lot of dust: mirrors, ceiling fans, and windowsills. When there was a plumbing issue - we were offered 20% off of our next stay, and that was a bit disappointing. It would have been nice if a discount or refund was given to the current stay. Overall it was a great weekend."

Besides all you can expect from an Airbnb home for a few days, you will have kitchen privilege and can do your laundry for a long term stay. Everything is labeled properly so that the guests will know where to find what. The location is an extra plus, easy to access the main throwaways in the Twin Cities metro area. I highly recommend whether if you are a out town visitor or a corporate relo for an extended stay,"

In addition to having access to the Three Rivers biking and running trail so close by, you are close enough to downtown Minneapolis and a host of other towns as well.\nRyan's house rules are very detailed,  which is designed to root out any riff-raff. Upon meeting him at length only once, he was genuinely a nice guy.  Ask about his Podcast channel as well!"

With all the sights, sounds, crowds, stress and what not that comes with travelling and doing business at downtown Minneapolis, the coming home and having a quiet, soothing and comfortable rest and sleep in the evening at Ryan’s place is something that every traveller won’t exchange for. There’s lots of rules and guidelines in the house but all of these make our stay in order!"

The house is beautifully decorated and ideal for short stays, for longer stays it gets a little inconvenient as the shared bathroom is used by two other roommates (was always occupied when I had to get ready for work in the morning) and the guest refrigerator is old and inefficient. Also the hosts did not respond to my questions which contradicted what the other reviews say."

However, I do not recommend this place. There are truly an absurd amount of strict rules, some of which conflict, to the point that it’s difficult to really exist while staying here. No parking on the street, but also no parking on half of the driveway, even if the rest of the driveway is full. No food in the room, but also no using the kitchen past 10, so if you have a slightly different schedule you’re out of luck. Leave the fan on for 15 minutes after showering, but don’t you dare leave it on past that, and no being in the bathroom longer than 10 minutes to turn it off. This is just the start of the list. And Ryan is not afraid to bang on your door repeatedly while you’re obviously on a call to ensure you’re following these rules exactly. I would never come back. Not welcoming."

We tried to keep the host's perspective top of mind, as they are renting out a bedroom in their home, and that can be very challenging.  Ryan is a clear communicator with excellent instructions but definitely comes off with an edge.  The rules are  strict and a bit intolerant.  It is not welcoming at all.  Go to your room, stay there, and do not make noise.  The list of what you are not allowed to do is significantly longer than what you can do.  I can't say I blame him, BUT it did make for a less-than-enjoyable stay.  If you want a place to sleep and don't mind sharing the host's home, this is great.  If you have any downtime and want to be on your phone past 10:00 pm, this is not the place for you.  I would not put another one of my employees here again, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't suit someone else.  Worth the price if you are good with the rules."

Suzanne oli mukava ja ystävällinen majoittaja, auttoi ja neuvoi tarvittaessa muttei häirinnyt millään tavalla. Talo oli hieno ja siisti, Suzannen 2 kissaa olivat rauhallisia ja ihmisystävällisiä. Talo sijaitsee suht kaukana keskustasta, kävellen noin 40 minuuttia, mutta taksilla tai uberilla matka ei ole pitkä. Myös bussit kulkevat suht läheltä taloa. Suosittelen lämpimästi ja majoittaudun tulevaisuudessakin tänne mielelläni."

Location’s great too since it’s fairly close to downtown, and safe since it’s right by a school. Really really enjoyed my first visit to Minneapolis because of this place. And oh, the two B&W cats were definitely a plus."

For cats. ;) I chose this place based on the many 5-star reviews and I can now confirm that they were 110% deserved! :) My favorite small touch was the scented candles available in the bedroom and bathroom."

We were made to feel welcome and wanted.  They offered tips on where to go and what to see.  The room and bed were comfortable.  We loved every moment of our stay.  All the little extra touches made it even more special. (Coffee was ready and waiting in the morning!)  Their two cats are very friendly without being in the way, we made fast friends.  Every part of our stay was over the top wonderful!  Thank you both for all your hospitality!"

Clean, warm (I know, hard to believe in Minneapolis in early Feb), and perfectly located a quick Uber ride away from everything.  What makes Suzanne's place so excellent though is Suzanne (and Jenn).  They are beautiful people, loving, generous, and terrific \"ambassadors\" for Minnesota.  We were well cared for, and slept quite comfortably.  Well done!"

Unfortunately I did not get a chance to use the hammock in their grassy back yard."

Plus you're living with two very sweet cats.\nThe bedroom and private bathroom are very clean, and I appreciated that Suzanne took care to leave out detailed instructions and notes to inform of you everything a guest needs to know. I would definitely stay here again!"

I felt like my privacy was respected but also that I could make myself at home and was welcome to use the kitchen, living room, laundry and join in when there was stuff happening! Lots of tips for getting around and what to do. The bed was super comfy. I was staying with total strangers but it honestly felt like family! Would recommend to anyone traveling to Minneapolis and I hope to stay again! \nThank You! :)"

Classic, well-maintained and updated older home with wonderful architectural details. Two friendly cats. Great kitchen. Off-street parking. Convenient to Downtown. It's a 2-minute walk to the bus stop, and you can easily get anywhere. This is an urban neighborhood in the process of renewal. As you walk through this area, you will see a variety of properties and conditions. That said, I felt safe and encountered no problems, even coming home late on the bus. There is a lovely park with fun playground equipment only a few blocks away. Suzanne is thoughtful and organized. Communication with her was easy and quick. I would definitely stay here again. Very highly recommend! 5 stars!"

We enjoyed playing with the cats but they did not come into our bedroom or bathroom so they would not bother you if you did not want to interact with them. Suzanne and Jen are friendly but give guests space and privacy. We did have a slight issue with check in but the hosts were responsive, apologetic and gave us a refund for the issue. I would stay with Suzanne again next time I am in Minneapolis."

The bathroom is modern, it was clean and the shower was easy to use. The bedroom was very comfortable. The cats are so friendly and funny! Best part though, the hosts were kind and easy to get along with."

Warm clean very comfortable house and a nice bedroom with your own private bathroom to use.  Lots of thoughtful touches like lovely toiletries in the bathroom,  a charger plug for your cellphone,  and books with recommendations.  Suzanne and Jen let me use their washing machine and dryer, dropped me down to a local cafe when my dinner plans fell through and were always happy to answer questions.  Handy to the bus into downtown and not too far to the light rail to get to/from the airport. Two very cute cats too. I recommend eating at Maria's cafe a few blocks down from their place for breakfast or lunch."

The Global Market is just a short drive away and \"Eat Street\" is on the way to the downtown area. The house was very clean and quiet.  All amenities were as advertised, although we didn't take advantage of anything in the kitchen other than for filling our water bottles.  The two cats, Bear and Yoda, are very friendly.  The off-street parking spot behind the house was nice.  We would gladly stay at Suzanne's place again in the future!"

Their home is a very clean and well kept historic house in south Minneapolis not far from the Global Market, Matt’s Bar, among other MSP landmarks. It was more like staying with friends, than other AirBnB experiences I’ve had. Their cats Bear and Yoda were super friendly. The room was just what we needed for the week. Would definitely stay with them again."

Also great location if your active, being a few blocks away from the Greenway where you can walk, run, bike, rollerblade, etc.... Suzanne is a great cook and offers to have you join them for dinner on any given night. Very easy to talk to and great conversationalists. Bear, their cat, is also very friendly and talkative as well. I would highly recommend staying with them if ever in the Minneapolis area and I will be back. Thanks ladies."

I communicated with Suzanne and Jen to let them know I did not expect a refund due to my sudden change of plans, but they graciously gave me a partial refund anyway which was very kind. I hope to meet them someday!"

Intimate setting but so comfortable with sharing space with such a great couple. You will hear joyful laughter in the other room a lot, which was extremely healing for my soul. \nI absolutely love the neighborhood. Small park about 2 blocks, but about 10 blocks in the same direction  is a much larger park with lakes etc. Loved watching the sunset on the frozen lake there. I recommend bus #5 for getting around because it runs so often. No need to worry about schedules. Lots of diversity and nice people everywhere you go with a strong sense of community. My people.\nI am already looking forward to staying there again in the Summer."

The mattress is neither firm nor soft. The pillows were a bit lumpy but comfortable enough. We slept well. Had our own washroom with a nice shower and a bidet!  We were encouraged to use the kitchen and we found the things we needed. We will definitely return."

What she didn’t know at the time I was going through something so for her to be there and allow me to vent meant a lot to me! Would definitely recommend any one to stay! And the Cats were so sweet they are pretty big lol but they are so lovable !"

Everything was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. If I was to come to Minneapolis again I would definitely stay at Suzanne’s if her place was available."

I was able to bike everywhere which saved me hundreds of dollars that were then spent on dining out and  local attractions. Not only was their home in the heart of Minneapolis, St. Paul was a gorgeous forty minute bike ride away where the ride itself is an attraction. The Midtown Greenway is excellent, and Venture Bikes is half a mile away if you need a bike or to service one that you already have. I will be sad when I leave and have to say goodbye to Mitsy, their chatty kitty. I'm grateful that Suzanne and Jen opened up their home so travelers like me can get to experience the wonderful twin cities."

I came to Minneapolis for the 2022 APA Convention, and she made her I had everything I needed and was able to let me check in early when my last accommodation plan fell out unexpectedly (and at like 7am at that)! The private room was nice and clean, but the shared bathroom was not bc there were hairs of other tenants laying around--which is something I can be very anal about lol---I'm not even sure if they wiped the toilet seat before and after they used it bc I could not locate the spray and paper towels Jessica told me about in the instructions! However, I enjoyed that we all stood out of each other's way, especially with COVID and now monkey pox spreading like wildfire! This is a great place to stay if you don't mind having your own room and you're in a time and (financial) crunch! Thank you Jessica!!!<3"

On my check-in day, my mother’s flight was rescheduled 3 nights later and she accepted to let her stay with me. I also liked the proximity of this house to the green metro station as well as supermarkets, restaurants and shops. It still didn’t feel the safest, though. \nThe things I suffered from in my stay included the following: \n- Dirty and unorganized kitchen because the other guests didn’t wash their dishes regularly, clean the area after cooking or take the trash out. *the professional cleaners came every week or two. \n- The basement (where the washer and dryer were) was spooky and not well-lit \n- The central AC wasn’t cooling my room enough. There wasn’t a table fan either. \n- There we’re only two electric outlets in my room, one which was used for the mini fridge, so it was a struggle to charge all my electronics sufficiently.\n- It’d have been nice if the room had a rug or colorful decoration and bedding. \n- The other guests were very loud at times and would walk around the house or leave and come back in late night and early morning hours (Jessica was very supportive in reaching out to them but it didn’t solve the issue entirely unfortunately). \n- This wasn’t the best place for me as a young female."

The host was nice and very informative and easy to work with i ended up extending my room 4 times and she was easy to work with. I would stay there again for sure."

The interior is spotless, spacious, updated, and furnished to entertain.  There were 3 couples in our group and the rooms were more than perfect except we did have to flip a coin for who got to stay in the main \"master\" on the main level or in the two other rooms on the next level up !  Unfortunately, it was too cold to enjoy the top patio/balcony but it looked like it would be a lot of fun in good weather.  Bill, our host, was very pleasant and helpful.  He called just before our arrival to go over the things he thought we needed to know.  Once we arrived in town we had did have a few questions and Bill immediately answered our calls and texts. We can't wait for summer so we can hopefully stay again and experience Stillwater in warmer weather."

My group was retired teachers looking to explore a city, enjoy the restaurants, shop, and spend time on the rooftop of this rental.  Wow,  just wow!  Beautiful view from the rooftop as well as from inside the house of Stillwater and the river!  Pictures don't do this place justice!  VERY spacious for 8 of us!  Would recommend that anyone looking to visit Stillwater check this place out!  A gem right on Main Street.  You can park your car  (they give you parking permits, so super easy to find parking), you never have to get in your car until you checkout.  Great location in a fun city.  Thanks to these hosts, made this experience so wonderful!"

The photos don’t do enough justice of how absolutely stunning this airbnb is! The rooftop patio was perfect for people watching and an amazing view. We walked to everything we did for the weekend, everything was perfectly close. Lots of really cute shops and amazing food around. The beds were extremely comfortable and the skylights in two of the rooms added a wonderful ambiance. Beautiful and well decorated bathrooms as well. The only thing I could think of that wasn’t perfect about our stay was the stairs to get in, my calves got a pretty good workout this weekend, but it’s to be expected with a loft style condo. Overall I don’t think I could’ve had a more perfect stay! Thank you to the hosts for making this weekend as comfortable and carefree as possible!"

Bars, restaurants, the water, coffee shops - it’s all there within a few steps of their place.  \nOnly regret, wish I would have booked an extra night to experience Stillwater 1 more day."

Anil and Sunny were extremely responsive from the time I booked the reservation through the day we all checked out. \nThe rooftop deck is very nice even though we did not get a chance to fully utilize it due to weather. The utensils in the kitchen were hard to find because there are drawers within drawers in the kitchen. You can tell that Anil and Sunny invested in a nice setup for their guests and it shows! \nIt can be a bit warm in the individual bedrooms so I would recommend brining a box fan for hot days if you are staying on the second floor in the summertime but we came prepared for that possibility and managed to stay cool at night in the upstairs bedrooms.\nIf you are looking to have a location right in downtown Stillwater for your stay, look no further. While this property is not inexpensive by any means it certainly is worth it!"

The door was a little finicky but they were super responsive and answered so promptly when issues arose! \nWe had 10 girls and fit comfortably with 3 girls in king bed, 2 girls in each queen bed (3 total in the second floor loft), and 1 mattress in the main room. We loved the rooftop and main living space to hang out. It honestly is bigger and more spacious in person than pictures show. I was amazed when I walked in!!\nDownsides: It was hard to find things in the kitchen, but got the hang of it the more we used them. The A/C seemed to be a little spotty and never quite figured it out but we survived and had a great time despite some areas being warmer than others!"

We found Eliza's apt on AirBnB and it could not have worked out better. We were central to everywhere we needed to be and the place provided us with a great environment to get work done. Thanks Eliza!"

Lucky for us this was the case, because we were able to stay at Eliza's amazing apartment. This place is a gorgeous large three bedroom apartment, with a spacious living room, separate dining room and full kitchen. We were pleasantly surprised when we first saw the space, and loved that we were able to stay here. Eliza is also incredibly helpful and the location is very close to downtown. Perfect place to stay while visiting the Twin Cities."

The place was spotless and clean, cozy and comfortable.  Just the right mix of classic elegance (huge, chunky leather couches and beautiful wood work) and modern amenities (a killer kitchen I wish I had at home).  All that tucked into a great neighborhood just seconds from downtown!  Loved it!"

We were able to walk to the sculpture park/Walker Art Museum and Target Field for a Twins game. (The museum is down the block and stadium less than two miles.) The hilly neighborhood behind the condo has some breathtaking homes. We walked through it on our way back from Rye Deli - a lunch spot recommended by our host - and admired the spectacular architecture. \r\n\r\nThe condo itself is very comfortable and clean with historic charm that's well-kept and updated. (Eliza even left some coffee for us, and the bathroom was stocked with shampoo for guests.) It was nice to have wifi and a TV and communal areas to hang out and share a meal.\r\n\r\nThe only hiccup was the key drop-off. Eliza was out of town and there was a slight miscommunication with the person who was supposed to let us in, so we waited for an hour outside. (He was inside but didn't hear the bell and we had the wrong numbers for each other.) It was my first airbnb experience, so I was nervous, but it definitely ended up working out just fine! \r\n\r\nWe wished we'd decided to stay another day and are already thinking about a return visit! We'd definitely stay here again if it remains as affordable. A terrific value."

I am a Minneapolis resident, and chose this property to host my family based on its location; I knew it was in the right place, but was thrilled that the space was so functional and well-appointed. An upstairs unit in a lovely part of town.\r\n\r\nWe rented this space for a long-weekend family reunion for 2 single adult children, and two boomer (separated) parents. The condo gave us all enough room for ourselves and was a welcoming space for us to be together. The layout allows for early risers to get up, make coffee, and sit with the tv without disturbing those still sleeping (or in the opposite direction: stay up with a glass of wine and good conversation while others sleep soundly). \r\n\r\nWe were in the space during a very cold spell in December (windchill - 18), and the home was warm, no drafts, and we could control the temperature ourselves. The beds were comfy and cozy, plenty of pillows and extra blankets available. The cabinets were stocked with spices so that we could cook at home. And Eliza was generously flexible with allowing me to stop in early to pick up the key for the unit since I happened to be in the area. \r\n\r\nThe family is already talking about their next visit!"

We really enjoyed the space though the snowy winter day would have been further enhanced by some crackling logs in fireplace. \r\nThe location was very. Convenient to the Walker, where we were attending a performance, as well as to park spaces, good restaurants, coffee shops, grocery, etc.  it was quiet with easy access to major thoroughfares.  I'd stay here again."

The location is outstanding.  It is near the Walker, across from a main east/west bike trail, and two miles from downtown.  Groceries, coffee shops and interesting neighborhoods are all very close. Eliza and her husband were ready to answer questions and provide any help that was needed.  Parking behind the building was a snap."

Eliza was accommodating our evening arrival and check-in booklet was a great help in getting us the details about the unit. Beds were comfortable and each bedroom had a working window AC unit. It is an upstairs unit with a separate entrance and stairs. There is only one bathroom, so be mindful of this if you have a larger group staying. With 3 women, we had to strategically plan our bathroom time in the morning. We wished we had more time to enjoy the unit and the area, would definitely stay there again."

The downsides for us, However the beds were not good for us, and we had to ask for a resolution, which Eliza provided after discussion with airbnb. The apartment floors are sloped which was a problem for me and anyone with mobility challenges needs to know before renting this apartment. The laundry is down in the basement which has a staircase landing that is coming away from the floor and to us didn't seem very safe at all. The apartment door lock is difficult to get the key in. Felt sorry for the downstairs guests as the floors creaked quite a bit. The open fireplace is lovely but not useable as it is sealed. Overall the apartment was large.  The Netflix on the Apple TV was a godsend for my husband who had all day to fill in while I was training."

The home itself is beautiful. It's an older Victorian style home wood floors high ceilings with beams and radiator heating. The kitchen is modern and has been updated.  The bedrooms are large and the beds very comfortable. Eliza has lots of pillows and towels for guests with huge closets in bedrooms for guests to unpack. The place was very spacious and comfortable for myself and my two adult children traveling with me.  I would recommend Eliza's beautiful home and would definitely stay there again when traveling to Minneapolis"

It's a beautiful walk to the nearby sculpture garden and park (designed by Olmstead). The home is large/spacious for 3-4 people, and my colleagues and I had a great time staying there for our conference downtown. I could also see this unit being very accommodating for a small family of 4-6 people. Thank you Eliza! It was so nice to be in Minneapolis during the fall (leaves are changing!)"

The location really could not be beat -- running/biking trails begin on the other side of the road yet there is very easy access to highways and the Walker Art Center/sculpture garden just a short 5 minute walk away. It is evident that this is a rental apartment, personal touches are not its specialty, but that way the rules of rental are very clear and laid out, and the amenities it provides are nonetheless very comfortable. We had an issue with a blocked toilet, Eliza was quick to respond and sent a repairman to fix it even though it was New Year's Day."

I would reccomend paying the $180.00 for this place if you need 2 or 3 bedrooms, and you want to be able to walk a half mile or so into downtown.\nThe photos are accurate, and at the same time the photos somehow depict it to be a modern, and a romantic place to come to. But actually it is a very old building and a bit worn. The inside is clean, very spacious and functional.\nThe kitchen is good and newly remodeled. One of the beds was comfortable, the other one was questionable.\nYes I would stay here again if I needed 2 or 3 bedrooms. But wouldn't come back and pay $180 as a romantic getaway type place."

Walking in, you instantly feel at home with wonderful space and everything you need. When preparing a conference dinner I was holding at the apartment, she was able to help with what I needed immediately. If you want to go for a morning run/walk/bike, there is a wooded trail right outside the door.  If you are heading downtown, it's a lovely walk through Loring Park, and all other neighborhoods feel very accessible with little confusion (even with the construction at the Walker). I cannot recommend the apartment or Eliza highly enough."

Eliza responded to my texts about other small items but she never fixed the lights. \nThe location was good: quiet & safe.  We parked right in front. It was an easy walk to the Walker Museum. Good food coop and restaurants near by."

The laundry downstairs is not ideal as it is in a very old, damp unfinished basement. But the place has 3 bedrooms in an ideal location that worked for us for 2 weeks."

Of course we couldn't leave our two dogs and Eliza was very gracious to accommodate us even though she normally doesn't allow pets. We really appreciated it!\nHer cohost was excellent and communicated quickly the entire time. The bathroom was not the cleanest (which happens from time to time especially because Eliza was out of town and it's not always possible to check the cleaner) but Jason (cohost) came right after we mentioned it and cleaned it personally.\nWe really looked forward to using the fireplace but when we got there it was decorative use only. That was a disappointment but I believe she changed the listing to reflect this and be more clear. Overall we would definitely recommend staying here!"

AC in bedrooms works great, but stand-alone AC unit in living room does not sufficiently cool down common areas. the AC helps for sure, but if you're heat sensitive it's best not to stay here in very warm weather."

The apartment itself is super spacious (even more than the pictures show!), and it had everything I needed. Aaron (apartment host) was incredibly friendly and responsive. So grateful to have been able to make this place home for a few months!"

The apartment is good, could use a deep professional clean and a new couch, but was overall a good value. There is no central air, but the portable and window units did cool it down despite the 90 plus degree days we were here. We would recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a reasonably priced home base for a week."

We were in town for a Twins baseball game and found the ballpark easy to access from here.  The beds are very comfortable and it is a spacious setting.  The only thing to make note of is that the stairs leading up to the apartment are a little steep, so if someone has mobility issues, that may be a concern, otherwise they shouldn't be a problem.  Eliza and her co-host Aaron were great with communication and kind enough to make some recommendations on breweries and restaurants in the area.  They even provide a nice little packet on the coffee table with some local recommendations.  Highly recommend considering this location if your going to be in the area."

We were visiting our son who lives in Minneapolis and another daughter and her boyfriend came up as well.  On Saturday we went to the Minnesota State Fair in St. Paul and the Twins/Brewers game at night at Target Field.  We had dinner Friday night at The French Meadow Restaurant and on Sunday went to Lagos Tacos for brunch after walking through Sculpture Park taking in the great art work.  Delicious food and always so many great restaurants in the Twin Cities to try.  So much fun and wonderful family memories were made.\nKindly,\nNancy & Dan Battist\nMadison, WI"

Not sure where they go at night. And in the shower. Im a tent/car camper so im not really bothered by it. And they don't bite. We didn't use the TV to watch our movies, because the remote had battery acid leaking from the interior. We did our best not to be loud as we walked through the apartment, but its an older home from 1916 I believe, so impossible not to creek with most steps. The beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows for me. I have back issues and slept great. The extra heavy blankets helped. The morning we left, the apartment didn't have power. So I'm glad my phone was charged. I heard a loud bang in the morning so maybe a transformer outside blew? I called a couple times before we left, but never had contact or was contacted. Great location near uptown, downtown and interstate entrance and exists, and a very nice, short walk to Walker art garden and museum. Hidden beach is not far at all and a nice drive to other lakes. Very beautiful homes in the neighborhood. We were pretty busy on our stay, so our time spent at the house was minimal during the day. We had one less adult with us than expected, so my daughter got the other queen bed. She was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean other than a few bugs. Plenty of hot water, as well as good water pressure. Shower guy. The kitchen, which we really didn't use, was also clean, not perfect , no complaints, but it could use a new microwave. Lots of light in the living areas, even though the apartment faces north. Avid readers, so that was nice. Had the place for 3 nights."

Cushions on the sofa and loveseat sag when sat on, and most of the end tables and bed stands are beat up and scarred. We had considerable trouble with the heat; the evening we arrived, the heat had not been turned up and the apartment temperature was in the 50's. It took several hours for the old warm water radiators to heat the place to a comfortable temperature. Using the laundry in the basement is an uncomfortable experience, as the stairway is dusty and cobwebbed, while the basement itself is cluttered, damp, poorly lit, and smelly.\nThe saving grace is the neighborhood, which is enchanting. Downtown Minneapolis is a pleasant walk away, and the Sculpture Garden is a beautiful place for a stroll."

Aaron, Eliza's co-host, responded to the couple of messages we sent quickly and with detailed information.  Some of the appliances in the kitchen have a few quirks (the dishwasher door squeaks loudly, and it seems the stove's \"lock\" function is a bit finicky), but we had all the kitchen tools we needed to make what we had planned on.  The nearby park is great for walking, and Dunn Brother's Coffee was a great breakfast/lunch shop within walking distance.  All in all, it was a good place to call \"home\" for 5 days, and I'd be happy to stay there again."

The living room area felt like our own classy hotel lobby with big comfy couches and armchairs. The neighborhood is also great, as we took walks to the lakes, the sculpture garden, coffee shops, and a nearby brewery. Would definitely stay again."

Communication was great, instructions clear and apt has everything you need to settle in - kitchen tools galore, cleaning supplies, trash bags, even spare batteries for remotes. \nBuilding is secure, well kept and parking spot is right by an entrance with a security camera. We had a snow storm during our stay and snow removal was fast. Bed was very comfortable - Mr.  likes soft, I like firm and we were both happy!\nWe both worked remote and can confirm WiFi is excellent. Office even has a whiteboard, pens and an electric sit stand desk! \nThe only negative is totally out of Russell's control. The resident upstairs is a big guy with a firm footstep who must work from home. I'll be the first to admit I'm sensitive to neighbor noise and it didn't bug my hubby. But if you're sensitive you may hear him at all hours.\n5 ⭐ stay! Highly recommend!!"

Very quiet and a perfect getaway! \nShort Lyft ride to Rice Park/Excel Center (though walkable if you’re up for it). Loved the nearby breweries too. \nSuper fast responses from the hosts- as well as checking in with us via the app to see how things were going. \nOne of our best Airbnb stays!"

I literally can not speak highly enough about this host. I had to give her a hug when I left, because she felt like an old friend. \nAs for the unit itself,  it looked and felt like a page out of a West Elm magazine. The furniture was clean, the layout was spacious but cozy, snacks & refreshments where provided, the bed was comfy, and the bath towels were plush. I loved staying at Kealani’s place. I hope to stay again next time I am in Minneapolis. <3"

We were treated as dear friends visiting from out of town; they went far above and beyond to assure our comfort, enjoyment, convenience, and ease, even to VOLUNTEER to come out in a snow storm at midnight to pick us up after our concert, knowing that the weather would create transportation issues downtown. Simply incredible!\nI'm already conceiving a reason to go back and stay with them again!\nDo I recommend their place? Absolutely! \nAre they good hosts? Indisputably!\nDid our stay exceed our expectations? Exponentially!\n1000% recommended! ❤️\n(And I'm going to need that cookie recipe!)"

The kitchen was stocked full of goodies, they had a booklet of recommendations, the shower was IMMACULATE and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud.

Their attention to detail was very on point as it’s apparent they’ve paid attention to the little things. They were very responsive hosts and offered wonderful local recommendations. We’re hoping to book with them again sometime although I think the word is getting out about just how awesome this place is because they were already booked for the next time we’re planning to be in the area. Oh well, hopefully the next guests enjoy their stay just as much as we did."

They have done great work to have the place modern, clean and ready for guests. They were quick to respond and help with anything we needed. There were many thoughtful details - the welcome sign, yummy snacks and drinks, games in the dresser, extra supplies in the bathroom. We actually had vehicle problems while we were there and they were super helpful and understanding to get our stuff out of the house for checkout and to our van before the tow truck came."

There were so many amenities. These guys literally thought of every possible thing that somebody could have forgotten at home and so it felt like I was right at home I quickly realized I forgot a hairdryer toothpaste and even make up remover’s and she had all of those plus so much more. These guys are incredibly friendly, very responsive, and. Very helpful. I honestly felt like I was in my own little apartment. It was very private and you never would’ve guessed it was in somebody’s home. Honestly, I liked it better than my own apartment at home. Lol I also like because I work third shift I sleep a lot during the day and it’s pretty dark down there with all the lights off so it was easy to get naps in during the daytime. The check in process was easier than any other place I’ve stayed."

Everything was as expected and listed! Hosts take care of all housekeeping needs after your stay, leaving check out quick and effortless! Great find in a charming house. *The stairs were quite steep and the air conditioner was loud,  but neither of these bothered us to any degree that impacted our stay, just something to be aware of."

While we didn’t use it, we appreciate that there was laundry access as well.\nOnly minor thing to be aware of, the stairs leading down to the bnb are a little narrow, so just be careful getting down there if you have mobility issues."

The location is on an interestingly laid out street, that feels quiet and peaceful but is steps from amazing breweries and restaurants. And they were super friendly and communicative, which helped us feel welcome and at ease after hours of driving. A few notes about the place: they have clearly put a lot of love and hard work into this cozy place, and it was obvious as they left us drinks and snacks in the fridge, supplies on the side of the bed, and other intuitive and helpful things (morning coffee, a well-organized list of restaurant and other recommendations, and other items) that helped make us feel right at home! Honestly I wasn’t ready to check out, and would love to stay at their place again. Highly recommend this gem! -Mike and Michael and our pup"

It was raining when we got to town and Rudy and Kealani responded immediately to let us know it was totally fine to check in early and quickly popped out to help when we used to wrong number to get into the space. The space itself is lovely- thoughtfully supplied with snacks and beverages,  large bathroom with a shower with excellent water pressure, modern and comfortable aesthetics. We especially loved the fenced in backyard! Would stay here again!"

Kealani posted photos of how to get into her place which was extremely helpful. We appreciated the variety of drinks and snacks available AND the half and half for our coffee. Kealani gave us recommendations for dinner, and we walked to Burger Moe's the first night. The next night we went to Pizza Luce, a short drive from the bnb. Both places were excellent."

One of our favorites was a restaurant called Gus Gus. Parking was convenient and the airbnb was easy to locate. It is in the basement, so take caution going down the stairs. I love that they had an info binder for guests. My one critique is that there isn’t much natural lighting and can be a little dark. Overall the space was clean and Kealani was super communicative and accommodating. She also kindly provided complimentary drinks and snacks for us. I most appreciated that there was half & half and non-dairy creamer in the fridge. Of all the airbnbs I have stayed at that provide coffee, very rarely do they have sweetener/creamer. If we find ourselves in St. Paul, we would definitely stay here again!"

Kealani designed the place with a lot of random touches, and it made the place extremely relaxing. It had pretty much everything you needed for a stay, and Kealani provided snacks and drinks! She was very responsive and answered any questions I needed. The bed was super comfy and cozy, but one of the coolest things was the shower! Overall, everything was clean, convenient to get around to, and just a comfortable place to stay. Highly recommend."

Both mornings we walked to Hope Breakfast Bar, which was excellent.  Kealani was quick to respond to any questions & checked in to make sure we had what we needed!

While small, the area is well decorated and clean, with very thoughtful amenities provided by the host. It was all the room we needed and we would definitely stay again. It was very quiet and cozy with no noise from upstairs…maybe could hear footsteps occasionally but certainly no issue. The location was perfect for us with numerous restaurants in walking distance. The neighborhood is very cute and the host provided great local recommendations. On-street parking was easy and always available. If you are very tall, a larger person, or have mobility issues, you may struggle with the small, narrow stairway entrance. Check in and check out were a breeze and the host is extremely responsive. Highly recommend and I’m so glad we chose this place to stay!"

          "comments": "Man where do I begin! Lol This was by far the best airbnb I’ve stayed at for an extended period of time. Zhauna is amazing! No matter what time of night she can be reached and the house manager Deb is an absolute gem! Definitely stop and have some conversations with her if you ever see her while there. I’m a travel medical assistant and they were extremely accommodating and the amenities that were included definitely was a perk! Deb comes daily to do the laundry, general cleaning and to make sure the included amenities like coffee, sparkling water, almond milk and yogurt are stocked and for your use. Anything that needs their attention just let either of them know and they jump right on it. The location is perfect in my opinion, about a 5-7 minute walk to Abbott northwestern hospital, about an 8 minute drive to the target and Cubs and ALDI on East lake street. There are buses 1-2 blocks that will get you many places but if you want to really roam around I would recommend bringing your car or renting one. Other then that the location is quiet and safe near a Main Street but not crazy busy. House is clean and well accommodated, laundry in the basement soap provided. My room was the suite in the basement across from the laundry room very spacious and cozy in the summer and winter time I was there from (11/29-05/22)."

I have meet all three, hosts and co-host, and they are super people, helpful in every way to accommodate their guests and make ones stay as pleasant as possible. Zhauna provides all the amenities, along with some courtesy items, to cook ones own meals if one choses to do so; very economical.  Almost every day  Deb comes in cleans the common areas and restock items. I have even made friends with some of guests, and unexpected nice plus. \nAll in all, its has been a great experience staying at Zhauna’s and I can highly recommend it for what is offered and the price."

Zuauna provided all kinds of supplies for her guests in the kitchen, bathroom, and in our suite. The house was clean and the two other guests that were there during our stay always cleaned after themselves.  The house gets sufficient sunlight during the day and is well-designed. If I had any questions or needed anything, I texted Zhuana and she responded immediately.  The house is located a few blocks away from Nicollet St. where you can find a variety of bars and restaurants.  However, I didn't feel very safe walking at night on East Lake St."

I had my own bathroom that was very nice and clean. It even had a heater in the bathroom! I was never bothered by anyone the entire time I was there. There was complimentary food and coffee which was a lifesaver! The other guests staying there (which I did not see ever) also made sure to clean up after themselves too. \nOverall, I had a wonderful stay and whenever I had a question they were quick to respond. 11/10!"

I believe in intentional hospitality, thoughtful communication, and unique touches. One of my favorite things about Airbnb over staying in a hotel is being able to drop into the vibe of a city; finding a lovely studio to practice yoga, the best place to get an Americano, the local market to pick up groceries and cook at home, and the nearest park to people watch on a bench. Hotels don't give you a 'home' feeling like Airbnb does. I take special care for my guests to enjoy the city and feel at home when they visit my spaces, and I love experiencing hosts who do the same for me when I travel. Please visit my guidebooks for the best of my home state, Minnesota!",

Big thank you to the hosts for being extra accommodating and friendly! I would definitely book here again."

Communication with the host was smooth and easy. However, I did notice that if you have no prior reviews, they require an in-person check-in, even if you've been using the app for years. Aside from that, it’s an excellent place with a very accommodating host. Highly recommend"
